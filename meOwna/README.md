## üéØ About the Project

**meOwna** is an intentionally vulnerable learning environment created for the Cybersecurity community. It serves as a practical lab for students and professionals who want to hone their web hacking skills or use a controlled environment for educational purposes and demonstrations.

In this lab, you will find books, learning references, technical terms, tutorials, and, of course, several vulnerabilities to explore and improve your knowledge.

## üîì Available Vulnerabilities

The environment is designed to explore a wide range of common web application security flaws. Some of the vulnerabilities you will find include:

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* Local File Inclusion (LFI)
* Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
* Local File Download (LFD)
* Broken Link Hijacking (BLH)
* No Rate Limit
* OS Command Injection
* Open Redirect
* Unrestricted File Upload
* Tabnabbing
* Clickjacking
* HTML Injection
* Information Disclosure
* And many more!

## üöÄ Getting Started

To start exploring **meOwna**, follow one of the installation methods below.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT WARNING:** This application is **intentionally vulnerable**. Never expose it to the internet or run it in a production environment. Use it only in a controlled and isolated environment, such as a virtual machine (VM) configured in "Host-Only" or "NAT" mode.

### Method 1: Using Apache2 (Recommended)

This method simulates a more realistic web server environment.

1.  **Install Apache2 and PHP:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php
    ```

2.  **Enable required PHP settings:**
    Edit the `php.ini` file (usually located at `/etc/php/[VERSION]/apache2/php.ini`):
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/php/$(php -r 'echo PHP_MAJOR_VERSION.".".PHP_MINOR_VERSION;')/apache2/php.ini
    ```
    Inside the file, find and change the following lines to `On`:
    ```ini
    allow_url_fopen = On
    allow_url_include = On
    ```
    *Tip: Use `Ctrl + W` in nano to search.*

3.  **Download and extract the project:**
    Navigate to your web server's root directory and download the project.
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/html/
    sudo wget https://github.com/OWASP/www-chapter-belo-horizonte/raw/master/meOwna/meowna.zip
    sudo unzip meowna.zip
    ```
    *This will create a `meOwna` folder inside `/var/www/html/`.*

4.  **Restart the Apache service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

5.  **Access the lab:**
    Open your browser and go to: **`http://localhost/meOwna`**

### Method 2: Using PHP's Built-in Server

This is a quick method to get the environment running without setting up a full web server.

1.  **Install PHP:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install php wget unzip
    ```

2.  **Enable required PHP settings:**
    Edit the `php.ini` file (usually at `/etc/php/[VERSION]/cli/php.ini`):
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/php/$(php -r 'echo PHP_MAJOR_VERSION.".".PHP_MINOR_VERSION;')/cli/php.ini
    ```
    Inside the file, change the following lines to `On`:
    ```ini
    allow_url_fopen = On
    allow_url_include = On
    ```

3.  **Download, extract, and start the server:**
    ```bash
    # Download the file
    wget https://github.com/OWASP/www-chapter-belo-horizonte/raw/master/meOwna/meowna.zip

    # Extract the file
    unzip meowna.zip

    # Navigate to the project folder
    cd meOwna/

    # Start the PHP server
    php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```
    *Using `0.0.0.0` allows you to access the lab from another computer on the same network.*

4.  **Access the lab:**
    Open your browser and go to: **`http://localhost:8000`**
